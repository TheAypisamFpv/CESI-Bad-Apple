# Courses
## Networking with Cisco Packet Tracer
### [Using the Programming function inside Computers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIxQzp-jLYk)
- Python script to print each frames. Because this python can't open files, and you can't create `.txt` files, the whole ASCII video had to be in the python file.
### Using Router 2960 (current)
- Python script to create the `bad_apple_router_config.txt` file containing all the frames (1 every 10 frames, scaled down by a factor of 3). Used in the router as a Startup Config, it get printed in the CLI at startup.
